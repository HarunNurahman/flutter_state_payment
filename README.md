# Flutter State Management - Subsciprtion / Payment
For this repository, I learn State Management with Flutter. I  create a subscription screen/page with different choices of payment methods (Monthly, Quarterly, Annually). After users choose the subscription, the checkout button will appear and will be set to the payment page.
